This was a little bit of code for an interview.

They wanted a meeting generator for the next six months.

They had a mid-morning (14th) meeting and a last day of the month meeting.

If the mid-morning meeting falls on a Saturday or Sunday then the mid-month meeting should be arranged for the following Monday.

If the last day of the month falls on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday then the meeting should be set for the previous Thursday.
